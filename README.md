# Flow

_Allows you to see stack overflow answers before you even attempt to search for it!_

Flow is currently a **python** debugging tool. The work_flow_ of the tool is as follows:

1. Try to run a python file, run into an `Exception`.
2. Formulate a search on stack overflow automatically, return question queries.
3. Display the results in a readable fashion.
